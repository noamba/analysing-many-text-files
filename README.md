Exercise instructions:

In the attached documents, find the most common occurring words, and the sentences where they are used to create the following table:

Word(#)         Documents           Sentences containing the word

philosophy      x, y, z             I don't have time for philosophy

                                    Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.

                                    Still, her pay-as-you-go philosophy implied she didn't take money for granted.


This is an example, you have the flexibility to modify the final output display as per your wish.
Idea behind it is to build a reusable solution which can be extended to other documents and text sources.
