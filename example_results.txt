In the following sentences:
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:5: When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:6: I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:9: To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:10: I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:11: And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:12: I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:13: I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:15: I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:16: In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:18: His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:19: And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:20: In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:21: The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:22: But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:27: Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:28: We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:29: And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:32: Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:33: It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:35: This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:36: Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:37: When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:42: Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:43: As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:45: A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:55: And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:60: My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:61: In just the last year, our own U.S. Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:62: But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:64: And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:66: It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:67: In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:68: And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:69: Corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:70: It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:71: What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:72: It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:73: Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:74: Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:75: Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:76: In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:77: And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:80: The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:81: Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of 2002.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:82: This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:84: In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:85: Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:86: The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:88: I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:89: We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:90: And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:91: So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:92: Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:93: And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:95: In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:96: Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:98: It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:99: It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:101: Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:103: When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:104: Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:105: The Kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:106: The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:108: As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:110: By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:112: They fight the fight of our time.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:114: You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:115: You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:116: And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:117: This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:118: I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:119: As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:122: As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:123: We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:124: In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:125: I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:0: Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:130: I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:3: In the face of war, you believe there can be peace.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:4: In the face of despair, you believe there can be hope.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:5: In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:6: That's the journey we're on today.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:131: And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:132: Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:12: And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:15: I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:16: It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:17: After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:18: I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:20: It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:21: I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:22: It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:25: That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:26: It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:27: And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:29: I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:30: But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:33: In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:34: In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:35: In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:36: We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:39: For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:45: It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:46: It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:48: We know the challenges.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:51: What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:52: What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:53: For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:54: And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:55: We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:56: And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:57: The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:58: They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:60: It's time to turn the page.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:62: I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:67: And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:72: Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:73: Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:75: Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:76: And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:77: Let's protect the hard-earned benefits their companies have promised.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:80: Let's be the generation that ends poverty in America.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:81: Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:83: Let's be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:84: We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:85: Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:86: Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:87: We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:89: We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:90: Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:91: Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:93: I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:94: We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:95: But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:97: Most of you know I opposed this war from the start.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:99: Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:101: It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:103: Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:104: Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:105: Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:106: Let us be the generation that begins this work.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:108: I understand the skepticism.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:110: All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:111: But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:114: This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:116: This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:119: But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:122: That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:124: As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:0: To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation; With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:1: Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:2: To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:3: I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:4: To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:5: Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:6: It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:8: Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:9: We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:14: But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:17: This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:18: This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:20: Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:21: This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:22: Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:23: And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:26: The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:27: And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:28: But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:29: Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time?
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:31: The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:33: He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:34: And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:36: Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:37: Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:40: These are the Americans that I know.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:41: Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:48: For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:49: In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:60: We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:61: We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:62: We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:63: The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:64: Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:65: In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:66: When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:67: And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:68: She's the one who taught me about hard work.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:69: She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:74: Theirs are the stories that shaped me.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:75: And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:77: It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:78: It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:82: It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:83: That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:84: That's the promise we need to keep.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:85: That's the change we need right now.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:87: Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:89: I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:91: Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:92: And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:93: Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:95: And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:96: Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:99: I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:100: I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:101: And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:102: America, now is not the time for small plans.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:103: Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:110: Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:112: If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:113: And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:114: Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:115: Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:116: And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:118: But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:123: But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:124: Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:125: And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:126: If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:127: For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:128: When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:129: John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:130: And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:131: That's not the judgment we need.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:133: We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:137: If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:138: We are the party of Roosevelt.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:139: We are the party of Kennedy.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:142: The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:143: As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:144: I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:146: But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:147: I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:148: And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:149: These are the policies I will pursue.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:150: And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:151: But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:152: Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:153: The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:156: The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:157: They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:161: The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:165: We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:166: The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:167: I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:169: This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:171: They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:173: Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:177: Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:181: I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:182: I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:184: What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:186: For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:187: You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:188: You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:190: Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:192: I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:198: In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:199: In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:200: I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:202: We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:203: Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:204: Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:206: It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:210: They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:211: But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:213: "We cannot walk alone," the preacher cried.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:214: "And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:223: At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:224: Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:225: Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America. 
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:1: As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:2: Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:4: This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:8: She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:9: Some of the tubes, he said, were filled with anthrax.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:10: Others, the plague.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:13: I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:15: Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:19: We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:20: Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:22: And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:23: Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:24: And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program?
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:25: With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:26: The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:29: First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:32: Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:33: For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:34: Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:35: In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:36: In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:38: Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:39: At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:40: As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:41: Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S. troops.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:43: Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S. Senate.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:44: Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:47: For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:48: And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:49: But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:51: One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:53: As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological threats.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:54: My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:55: On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:57: While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:58: But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:62: Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:64: Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:65: But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:68: One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:70: Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:71: Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:73: But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:74: It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:79: We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:84: But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:85: "Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:86: We all breathe the same air.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:1: Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:129: Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:3: It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:4: Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:7: I remember when I first ran for the state Senate - my very first race.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:135: At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:136: The first was in hairstyling; the other in braiding.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:10: And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:11: I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:15: And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:16: And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:18: And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:20: So I understand the cynicism.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:21: But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:22: We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:23: And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:149: And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:25: And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:26: And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:27: I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:28: That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:150: Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in?
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:30: I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:31: And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:32: And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:153: We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:156: Our time to write a new chapter in the American story.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:35: And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:36: And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:157: Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:158: And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:39: And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:40: And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:159: They can say that this was the time when America found its way.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:160: They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:43: She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:46: Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:48: In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:49: The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:53: Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:56: We've seen the cost of health care and child care and gasoline skyrocket.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:57: We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:58: But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:59: Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:60: It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:62: That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:63: That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:66: He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words: Had enough?
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:69: Enough of the broken promises.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:70: Enough of the failed leadership.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:71: Enough of the can't-do, won't-do, won't-even-try style of governance.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:72: Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:73: I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:74: I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:76: I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:77: I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:79: And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:85: The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:87: The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:89: It's called the Ownership Society in Washington.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:92: It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:93: It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:96: And it's the easiest thing in the world.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:100: Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:102: The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:110: And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:115: And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:116: So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:117: That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:118: Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:119: The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:121: Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:122: The party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:123: The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:124: Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:125: And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:126: And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:127: The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:0: Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:1: They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:2: making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:6: And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:8: to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:9: In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:10: a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:11: A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:12: Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:14: And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:16: “Mission Accomplished,” “cut and run,” “stay the course” ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:17: the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:18: a conflict that has only increased the terrorist threat it was supposed to help contain.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:22: The conflict has left us distracted from containing the world’s growing threats ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:24: And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:26: a strategy no longer driven by ideology and politics, but one that is based on a realistic assessment of the sobering facts on the ground and our interests in the region.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:27: This kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:28: The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:29: I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:32: We have been assured that the insurgency is in its last throes.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:33: We have been told that progress is just around the corner, and that when the Iraqis stand up, we will be able to stand down.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:34: Last week, without a trace of irony, the President even chose Vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:40: A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:41: According to our own Pentagon, the situation on the ground is now pointing towards chaos.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:42: Sectarian violence has reached an all-time high, and 365,000 Iraqis have fled their homes since the bombing of a Shia mosque in Samarra last February.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:43: 300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:47: In just the past three weeks, he has ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:49: “rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.” This is now the reality of Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:50: Now, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:51: I am committed to working with this White House and any of my colleagues in the months to come to craft such a consensus.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:54: For the fact is that there are no good options left in this war.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:56: And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:57: Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:58: What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:60: And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:62: They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:67: It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:71: namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:72: There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:74: It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:75: Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:81: Our troops can help suppress the violence, but they cannot solve its root causes.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:82: And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:83: I have long said that the only solution in Iraq is a political one.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:84: To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:86: Our best hope for success is to use the tools we have ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:88: to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:89: The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:91: When I first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:93: For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:96: The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:97: He should then work with our military commanders to map out the best plan for such a redeployment and determine precise levels and dates.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:98: When possible, this should be done in consultation with the Iraqi government ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:101: We cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:102: The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:104: Drawing down our troops in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:105: This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:106: Perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:108: Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai government, we are backsliding towards chaos.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:110: As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:112: But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:115: We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:117: The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:120: An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:122: any U.S. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:123: In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:124: Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:125: We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:127: standing up an army composed mainly of Shiites and Kurds will only cause the Sunnis to feel more threatened and fight even harder.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:128: The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:129: So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:130: But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:131: Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:132: This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:133: This means no more bloated no-bid contracts that cost the taxpayers millions in overhead and administrative expenses.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:135: But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:136: Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:139: But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:141: And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the Iraqis, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:142: The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:144: if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:146: We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:149: As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:150: Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:152: that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:153: And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:155: In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:156: This doesn’t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it’s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:157: But even as we provide such help, we should be clear that the institutions of democracy ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:159: cannot be built overnight, and they cannot be built at the end of a barrel of a gun.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:160: And so we must realize that the freedoms FDR once spoke of ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:162: do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:164: Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:166: If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:167: The final lesson is that in an interconnected world, the defeat of international terrorism ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:168: and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:169: We must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:170: But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:172: We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:174: The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:176: The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:177: The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:179: And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:181: and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:182: According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.” We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:183: 9/11 showed us that try as we might to ignore the rest of the world, our enemies will no longer ignore us.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:184: And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:185: But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:189: I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:190: I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:197: And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.

In the following documents: ./production_docs/doc4.txt, ./production_docs/doc1.txt, ./production_docs/doc2.txt, ./production_docs/doc6.txt, ./production_docs/doc3.txt, ./production_docs/doc5.txt
In the following sentences:
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:1: I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:2: My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:6: I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:7: When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:9: To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:11: And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:12: I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:13: I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:15: I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:16: In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:18: His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:19: And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:20: In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:21: The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:22: But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:28: We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:29: And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:33: It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:35: This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:36: Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:37: When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:39: It never did, and it never will."
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:41: This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:42: Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:43: As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:44: And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:45: A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:48: The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:49: It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:50: Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:51: One that serves its people and is free from corruption.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:52: There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:53: Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:54: You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:59: It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:61: In just the last year, our own U.S. Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:65: It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:71: What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:72: It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:73: Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:74: Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:75: Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:76: In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:80: The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:82: This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:86: The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:92: Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:93: And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:94: Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:95: In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:96: Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:99: It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:100: Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:103: When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:104: Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:106: The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:107: But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:108: As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:110: By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:115: You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:117: This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:118: I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:120: Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:121: I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:122: As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:123: We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:124: In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:125: I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:0: Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:128: I want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:129: I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:130: I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:131: And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:132: Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:14: I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:15: I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:16: It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:18: I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:20: It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:22: It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:25: That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:26: It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:27: And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:34: In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:35: In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:36: We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:37: Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:38: Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:44: But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:45: It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:46: It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:47: All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:51: What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:52: What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:53: For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:55: We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:56: And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:57: The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:58: They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:67: And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:68: Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:73: Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:74: Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:75: Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:79: And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:81: Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:84: We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:87: We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:89: We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:91: Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:93: I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:94: We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:95: But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:99: Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:103: Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:104: Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:105: Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:109: After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:110: All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:111: But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:114: This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:115: It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:116: This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:122: That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:124: As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:0: To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation; With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:1: Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:2: To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:4: To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:5: Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:6: It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:8: Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:9: We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:10: Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:11: More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:12: More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:14: But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:18: This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:19: We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:20: Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:22: Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:24: On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough."
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:26: The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:31: The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:34: And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:36: Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:39: They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:44: How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans?
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:45: How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:48: For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:62: We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:64: Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:65: In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:66: When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:71: And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:75: And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:77: It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:78: It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:79: Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:82: It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:87: Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:88: Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:89: I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:92: And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:93: Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:96: Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:98: As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:101: And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:104: Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:107: I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:108: And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:113: And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:114: Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:115: Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:117: Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:118: But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:120: It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength."
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:121: Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:122: Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:123: But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:124: Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:126: If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:127: For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:128: When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:130: And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:135: You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:137: If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:142: The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:143: As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:144: I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:146: But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:147: I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:148: And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:152: Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:155: I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:156: The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:161: The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:167: I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:169: This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:171: They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:179: If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:182: I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:186: For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:187: You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:190: Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:195: I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:196: I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:198: In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:200: I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:203: Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:206: It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:207: And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:208: The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:209: They could've heard words of anger and discord.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:210: They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:211: But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:218: Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:219: Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:220: Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:224: Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:225: Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America. 
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:1: As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:2: Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:4: This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:5: We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:8: She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:11: At this point I turned around and said "Hey, where's Lugar?
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:14: He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:15: Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:17: Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:18: And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:20: Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:22: And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:25: With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:26: The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:27: Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:29: First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:30: The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:33: For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:34: Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:35: In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:36: In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:39: At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:42: While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:44: Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:48: And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:49: But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:50: We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:51: One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:52: Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:54: My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:55: On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:58: But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:61: For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:62: Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:64: Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:66: We must safeguard these dangerous weapons, material, and expertise.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:68: One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:70: Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:71: Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:72: I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:73: But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:74: It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:76: It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:85: "Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:89: Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:1: Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:130: We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:3: It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:8: A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:9: Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:10: And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:11: I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:17: You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:148: I've often thought about Mireya and her simple dream and all those before her who've shared that dream too.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:150: Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in?
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:23: And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:24: And so I said fine, and I met her, and we talked.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:25: And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:26: And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:27: I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:154: Ladies and gentlemen, this is our time.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:157: Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:30: I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:158: And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:32: And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:33: How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:34: She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:36: And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:37: And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:38: She saw four little girls die in a Sunday school and catalyze a nation.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:39: And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:40: And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:41: She kept on voting in each and every election because she believed.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:45: Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:48: In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:49: The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:50: And with this new world comes new risks and new dangers.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:52: No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:55: And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:56: We've seen the cost of health care and child care and gasoline skyrocket.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:57: We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:61: The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:62: That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:63: That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:64: Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:66: He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words: Had enough?
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:74: I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:76: I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:78: I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:79: And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:88: That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees...
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:93: It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:102: The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:104: We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:107: We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:113: Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:117: That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:119: The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:120: The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:122: The party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:123: The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:124: Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:125: And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:127: The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:0: Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:1: They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:2: making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:3: This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:5: It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:6: And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:7: diplomatic, economic, and military ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:8: to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:9: In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:10: a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:12: Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:14: And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:16: “Mission Accomplished,” “cut and run,” “stay the course” ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:17: the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:23: in North Korea, in Iran, and in Afghanistan.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:25: These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:26: a strategy no longer driven by ideology and politics, but one that is based on a realistic assessment of the sobering facts on the ground and our interests in the region.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:27: This kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:28: The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:29: I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:30: Month after month, and then year after year, I’ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this war’s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:31: No matter how bad it gets, we are told to wait, and not ask questions.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:33: We have been told that progress is just around the corner, and that when the Iraqis stand up, we will be able to stand down.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:35: When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:37: Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:39: A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:42: Sectarian violence has reached an all-time high, and 365,000 Iraqis have fled their homes since the bombing of a Shia mosque in Samarra last February.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:43: 300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:48: and I’m quoting from a New York Times article here ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:49: “rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.” This is now the reality of Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:51: I am committed to working with this White House and any of my colleagues in the months to come to craft such a consensus.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:52: And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:57: Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:62: They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:64: money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:66: and that strategy must change.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:67: It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:68: Dreams of democracy and hopes for a perfect government are now just that ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:69: dreams and hopes.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:71: namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:74: It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:77: The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:79: They have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:80: But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:82: And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:84: To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:88: to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:94: that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:96: The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:97: He should then work with our military commanders to map out the best plan for such a redeployment and determine precise levels and dates.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:101: We cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:102: The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:104: Drawing down our troops in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:105: This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:106: Perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:107: The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:109: By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:110: As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:112: But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:113: in a public and unambiguous way ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:115: We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:116: Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:117: The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:120: An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:123: In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:124: Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:125: We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:127: standing up an army composed mainly of Shiites and Kurds will only cause the Sunnis to feel more threatened and fight even harder.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:130: But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:133: This means no more bloated no-bid contracts that cost the taxpayers millions in overhead and administrative expenses.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:134: We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:135: But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:136: Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:137: This includes opening dialogue with both Syria and Iran, an idea supported by both James Baker and Robert Gates.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:138: We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:139: But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:140: and within their own countries.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:141: And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the Iraqis, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:142: The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:144: if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:146: We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:147: It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:149: As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:156: This doesn’t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it’s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:159: cannot be built overnight, and they cannot be built at the end of a barrel of a gun.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:161: especially freedom from want and freedom from fear ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:162: do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:166: If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:168: and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:170: But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:171: This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:176: The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:177: The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:178: In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:179: And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:181: and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:182: According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.” We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:184: And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:185: But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:186: a policy based on blind hope and ideology instead of fact and reality.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:188: It’s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:189: I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:190: I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:193: There have been too many flag-draped coffins, and there have been too many heartbroken families.

In the following documents: ./production_docs/doc4.txt, ./production_docs/doc1.txt, ./production_docs/doc2.txt, ./production_docs/doc6.txt, ./production_docs/doc3.txt, ./production_docs/doc5.txt
In the following sentences:
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:0: The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:1: I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:2: My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:5: When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:15: I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:16: In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:18: His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:19: And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:21: The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:22: But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:27: Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:33: It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:34: Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:36: Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:40: As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:44: And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:45: A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:47: It cannot wait for other nations to act first.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:50: Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:53: Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:55: And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:60: My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:63: I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:64: And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:68: And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:70: It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:71: What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:72: It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:73: Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:75: Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:76: In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:79: Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in Kenya.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:81: Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of 2002.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:85: Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:86: The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:87: And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:88: I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:89: We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:90: And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:91: So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:92: Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:93: And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:95: In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:96: Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:97: Finally, ethnic-based tribal politics has to stop.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:98: It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:100: Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:101: Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:104: Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:108: As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:109: And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:111: By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:116: And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:118: I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:119: As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:120: Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:122: As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:123: We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future.
./production_docs/doc4.txt line:125: I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:0: Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:128: I want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:129: I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:130: I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:131: And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:5: In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:132: Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:7: But let me tell you how I came to be here.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:9: I moved to Illinois over two decades ago.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:13: My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:14: I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:15: I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:17: After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:18: I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:20: It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:22: It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:23: That's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:24: That's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:26: It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:27: And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:28: I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness - a certain audacity - to this announcement.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:30: But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:33: In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:35: In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:36: We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:37: Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:38: Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:45: It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:46: It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:47: All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:52: What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:55: We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:57: The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:58: They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:60: It's time to turn the page.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:62: I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:63: But Washington has a long way to go.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:65: That's why we'll have to set priorities.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:66: We'll have to make hard choices.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:67: And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:68: Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:72: Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:73: Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:78: Let's make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:79: And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:81: Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:84: We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:92: Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:93: I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:94: We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:95: But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:96: But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:100: America, it's time to start bringing our troops home.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:101: It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:103: Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:104: Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:110: All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:111: But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:115: It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:116: This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:118: Divided, we are bound to fail.
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:124: As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
./production_docs/doc1.txt line:127: Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:0: To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation; With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:1: Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:2: To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:3: I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:4: To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:5: Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:6: It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:8: Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:12: More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:14: But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:18: This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:20: Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:21: This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:23: And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:29: Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time?
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:30: I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:36: Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:37: Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:44: How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans?
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:45: How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:48: For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:57: Well it's time for them to own their failure.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:58: It's time for us to change America.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:62: We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:63: The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:64: Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:65: In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:66: When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:67: And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:75: And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:77: It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:78: It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:82: It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:84: That's the promise we need to keep.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:88: Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:94: In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:96: Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:98: As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:100: I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:101: And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:103: Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:109: And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:110: Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:112: If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:114: Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:115: Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:116: And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:120: It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength."
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:121: Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:122: Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:125: And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:126: If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:127: For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:128: When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:129: John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:130: And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:137: If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:142: The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:143: As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:145: I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:147: I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:148: And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:150: And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:152: Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:161: The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:164: And that's what we have to restore.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:167: I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:169: This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:172: And that's to be expected.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:173: Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:174: If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:179: If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:186: For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:187: You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:189: Change comes to Washington.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:195: I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:196: I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:203: Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:206: It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:207: And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:210: They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:217: Not with so much work to be done.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:218: Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:219: Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:220: Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:223: At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future.
./production_docs/doc2.txt line:224: Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:1: As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:2: Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:5: We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:6: Our guide then brought us right up to what looked like a mini-refrigerator.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:8: She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:12: Doesn't he want to see this?"
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:15: Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:17: Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:19: We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:20: Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:21: Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:22: And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:24: And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program?
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:25: With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:26: The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:27: Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:30: The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:32: Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:33: For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:34: Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:35: In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:36: In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:37: I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:39: At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:41: Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S. troops.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:42: While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:43: Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S. Senate.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:48: And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:50: We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:51: One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:52: Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:54: My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:55: On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:57: While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:58: But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:61: For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:62: Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:63: Our detention for three hours in Perm is a testament to these forces.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:65: But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:70: Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:72: I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:74: It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:75: And it means more sustained engagement, including more senior-level visits to Nunn-Lugar program sites.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:76: It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:78: We need to see more.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:79: We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:80: And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:85: "Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
./production_docs/doc6.txt line:89: Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:128: If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:130: We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:3: It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:133: And they want to believe again.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:134: A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:135: At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:10: And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:11: I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:138: And she began to cry.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:139: When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:141: I knew how to sew.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:15: And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:143: I'm trying to go to college.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:144: I don't need to sew to go to college.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:21: But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:149: And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:23: And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:153: We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:26: And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:155: Our time to make a mark on history.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:156: Our time to write a new chapter in the American story.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:157: Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:30: I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:31: And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:32: And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:158: And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:160: They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:36: And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:37: And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:40: And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:42: She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:43: She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:45: Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:46: Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:48: In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:51: No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:52: No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:53: Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:57: We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:59: Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:61: The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:63: That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:66: He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words: Had enough?
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:72: Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:73: I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:76: I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:77: I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:79: And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:85: The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:86: It's that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:88: That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees...
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:91: It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:92: It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:93: It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:104: We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:107: We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:108: That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:110: And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:111: Because I think that this is our moment to lead.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:115: And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:117: That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:120: The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:123: The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes.
./production_docs/doc3.txt line:125: And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:0: Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:1: They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:2: making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:3: This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:5: It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:6: And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:8: to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:9: In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:10: a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:11: A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:12: Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:13: Neither turned out to be true.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:18: a conflict that has only increased the terrorist threat it was supposed to help contain.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:24: And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:27: This kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:29: I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:31: No matter how bad it gets, we are told to wait, and not ask questions.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:33: We have been told that progress is just around the corner, and that when the Iraqis stand up, we will be able to stand down.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:35: When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:40: A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:41: According to our own Pentagon, the situation on the ground is now pointing towards chaos.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:49: “rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.” This is now the reality of Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:50: Now, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:51: I am committed to working with this White House and any of my colleagues in the months to come to craft such a consensus.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:52: And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:57: Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:58: What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:59: It is not enough for him to simply lay out benchmarks for progress with no consequences attached for failing to meet them.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:60: And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:64: money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:65: No, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos, but a failure of strategy ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:67: It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:70: We must instead turn our focus to those concrete objectives that are possible to attain ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:71: namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:72: There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:73: And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:74: It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:77: The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:80: But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:82: And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:84: To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:86: Our best hope for success is to use the tools we have ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:88: to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:90: a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:92: Such a timetable may now need to begin in 2007, but begin it must.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:93: For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:94: that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:96: The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:97: He should then work with our military commanders to map out the best plan for such a redeployment and determine precise levels and dates.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:101: We cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:104: Drawing down our troops in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:105: This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:106: Perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:107: The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:109: By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:110: As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:112: But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:115: We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:116: Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:117: The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:120: An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:123: In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:124: Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:125: We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:126: The security forces have to be far more inclusive ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:127: standing up an army composed mainly of Shiites and Kurds will only cause the Sunnis to feel more threatened and fight even harder.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:128: The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:129: So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:131: Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:132: This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:134: We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:135: But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:136: Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:138: We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:139: But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:142: The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:144: if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:145: It is in our national interest to prevent this from happening.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:146: We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:147: It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:148: This brings me to a set of broader points.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:150: Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:153: And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:155: In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:156: This doesn’t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it’s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:163: The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:164: Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:166: If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:169: We must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:170: But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:171: This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:172: We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:173: threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in Iraq.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:176: The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:177: The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:178: In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:179: And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:182: According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.” We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:183: 9/11 showed us that try as we might to ignore the rest of the world, our enemies will no longer ignore us.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:184: And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:185: But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:188: It’s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:189: I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:190: I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:195: It is time to change our policy.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:196: It is time to give Iraqis their country back.
./production_docs/doc5.txt line:197: And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.
